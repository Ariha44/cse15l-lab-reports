  * Open the installed package and follow the setup instructions
  * When it has finished installing, access VSCode by finding it in its set destination


2. Remotely Connecting
  * If you are using a Windows device, please install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and set VSCode's default terminal to use [Git Bash]([https://gitforwindows.org/](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994))
  * Open VSCode's terminal and enter the Secure Shell Protocal command to remote to your course-specific account (replace the `zz` with your course specific account ID letters):
    
    `ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
  * Read the instructions that show after entering the command to connect to the server. When asked for your password, enter the course account's password.
  * Here is an example of a successful connection:
